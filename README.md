My First Published Original Game.

Originally published to Google Play store, this game took several months of more or less consistent small steps to create. 
The Process made me realize that understanding really comes from doing the work myself, rather than consuming and following tutorials to the T; It also became clear that starting something like this from scratch is definitely more effort than anticipated.. 
but also that such a challenge can definitley be **FUN**.

Not sure why I haven't continued with games since, perhaps got too busy with other things in life.. Coming back to this page however inspires me to get back into it. I have ideas and a certain different kind of drive to create meaningful work now, let's see what comes next :)
